# Programmiersprachen 2021 - Gruppe C

This repository contains the code and executables for assignment 1 `./calculator` and for assignment 2 `./interpreter`.
The calculator is written in Java. Further instructions can be found in `./calculator/readme.md`.
The interpreter is written in JavaScript and the corresponding instructions can be found in `./interpreter/readme.md`.

## Work distribution
The original idea was that each of us three group members works on each assignment so that everyone has an understanding of what we were doing.
After two months of no contribution, Mr. Kokolli informed us about his shortcomings regarding the time for this lecture.
We agreed that the remaining group members finish assignments 1 and 2 and that he will try to work on assignment 3.
Unfortunately, Mr. Kokolli decided not to participate in this lecture and delivered nothing for assignment 3.
We, therefore, completed his reserved tasks from assignments 1 and 2 too and, to compensate for the additional work, dropped assignment 3 completely.

To check the delivered work we open source the repository after the submission deadline (30.7.2021) on Github: https://github.com/danielkleebinder/ps-2021
